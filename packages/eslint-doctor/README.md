# ESLint Doctor

Analyze your ESLint configuration.

## Overview

Configurations are hard.

Tools like [eslint-nibble](https://github.com/IanVS/eslint-nibble) are great for determining which rules to put into your configuration. But what if there's something wrong with your configuration in the first place?

This tool analyzes your ESLint configuration, and lets you know if there are potential problems with your ESLint setup.

Future iterations will include automatic fixing.

## Installation

`npm i -g eslint-doctor`

## Usage

Only run this in the directory where your `.eslintrc.*` and `package.json` files are located.

`eslint-doctor`
